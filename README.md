travisbloom.me
==============

The personal website of @travisbloom

Travisbloom.me was built using Bootstrap 3, JQuery, and Waypoints.js. Handlebars.js is used to easily update stories and add new content to the respective sections. The fonts used, Lato and Lobster 2, can be found on Google Fonts. All images/graphics used on the site were taken and created by me.
