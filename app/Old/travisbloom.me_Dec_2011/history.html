						I chose to enroll at the <a href="http://uconn.edu/"target="_blank">University of Connecticut</a> as a<a href="http://www.honors.uconn.edu/"target="_blank"> Honors student</a> after graduating from
						<a href="http://www.westonhsgov.com/"target="_blank">Weston High School</a> (where I served as President of the Senior Class).
						While the in-state tuition was definately a motivating factor, the <a href="http://www.business.uconn.edu/cms/p819"target="_blank">UConn 
						Business School's reputation</a> was the main attraction to the campus in Storrs, CT.</p>

						The first few months of my Junior year were somewhat stressful as I prepared and submitted applications for various IT internships. My number one choice was General Electric's prestigious <a href="http://www.ge.com/careers/students/imlp/index.html" target="_blank">
						Information Management Leadership Program</a>. After applying being interviewed, I was offered a position for the Summer of 2012. I eagerly
