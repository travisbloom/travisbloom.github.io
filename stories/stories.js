The app was built to fill a need that I saw semester after semester: there was no easy way to browse top ranked courses at my school. Offerings like RateMyProfessors.com were great if you already had a class in mind, but MyEasyClass’ reddit-style layout made it easy to quickly discover other course options.</br> The site was originally created using JQuery, Bootstrap, and <a href="https://parse.com/">Parse</a> (JQuery was eventually replaced with Angular.js). When it launched in spring of 2013 more than 1,200+ unique users visited the first month. During class registration the following fall, MyEasyClass had 5,200+ pageviews and 3,200 unique visitors. Putting this in to perspective, more than 20% of UConn\'s undergraduate population used the site.'

When a new version of the site is deployed, Gulp.js compiles the stories data to a Handlebars.js template and inject the outputted html in to my index.html file. This setup allows me to easily update stories and add new content to respective sections. '
